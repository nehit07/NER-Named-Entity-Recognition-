# NER-Named-Entity-Recognition-
This project develops a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to identify entities like names, locations, and dates in text. Using Python, spaCy, and pre-trained models like BERT, it handles real-world challenges such as ambiguity and multi-word entities. The system is adaptable across domains, ensuring robust and accurate text analysis.
